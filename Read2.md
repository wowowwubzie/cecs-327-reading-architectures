1. What is a three-tiered client-server architecture? 
- A three-tiered client-server architecture is a structure used in many cases, to organize data management. It uses three layers that can be used in transaction processing, where a transaction monitor coordinates the transactions. When this layer architecture is used in websites, a ‘web server acts as an entry point to the site, passing requests to the application server, which then interacts with a database server’, as mentioned in the textbook. The application handles the information being received, the processing layer gets the information from the data layer and translates it for the application layer, and the data layer is where the data lives.
