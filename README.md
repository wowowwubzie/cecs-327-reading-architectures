# CECS 327 Reading Assignment - Architectures

# Assignment Description
Answer the following questions from the Chapter 2 reading from 
your textbook. Be through and complete with your answers. You may 
work on these questions with a partner (no more than two working 
together), but both students must submit the document 
individually on Beachboard Dropbox along with both students’ 
names on each submission.

1. What is a three-tiered client-server architecture?

2. What is the difference between a vertical distribution and a 
  horizontal distribution?

3. If a client and a server are placed far apart, we may see 
  network latency dominating overall performance. How can we 
  tackle this problem?

4. Consider a chain of processes $P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots, P_{n}$ 
  implementing a multitiered client-server architecture. Process $P_{i}$
   is client of process $P_{i}+1$, and $P_{i}$ will return a reply to 
  $P_{i}-1$ only after receiving a reply from $P_{i}+1$. What are the 
  main problems with this organization when taking a look at the 
  request-reply performance at process $P_{1}$?

5. In a structured overlay network, messages are routed according 
  to the topology of the overlay. What is an important 
  disadvantage of this approach?

6. Consider an unstructured overlay network in which each node 
  randomly chooses c neighbors. If P and Q are both neighbors of R
  , what is the probability that they are also neighbors of each 
  other?

7. Not every node in a peer-to-peer network should become 
  superpeer. What are reasonable requirements that a superpeer 
  should meet?

8. Give an example of a self-managing system in which the 
  analysis component is completely distributed or even hidden.

9. Consider a BitTorrent system in which each node has an 
  outgoing link with a bandwidth capacity $B_{out}$ and an incoming 
  link with bandwidth capacity $B_{in}$. Some of these nodes 
  (called seeds) voluntarily offer files to be downloaded by 
  others. What is the maximum download capacity of a BitTorrent 
  client if we assume that it can contact at most one seed at a 
  time?

10. Modern cars are stuffed with electronic devices. Give some 
  examples of feedback control systems in cars.
